## **week 5: build an interactive copyright status assessment tool**

This week’s task was focused on creating an interactive online copyright assessment tool, aimed at helping users evaluate the copyright status of works within the context of two established frameworks: the QM’s EMu Copyright Documentation Guidelines and the GLAM-E Lab’s Copyright Clearance Handbook for Public Domain Publications of Digital Collections. The overall goal was to combine these two frameworks into a streamlined, user-friendly tool that will make copyright evaluations accessible for a wide range of users.

### Steps to Create the Tool:

#### 1. Understanding the Frameworks: 
The first step involved reading the two copyright assessment frameworks: QM’s EMu Copyright Documentation Guidelines and the GLAM-E Lab’s Copyright Clearance Handbook. I reviewed both documents carefully, identifying key questions, decision points, and guidelines in each framework.

#### 2. Creating Flowcharts with Mermaid: 
To visually represent the decision-making process involved in each framework, I created two detailed flowcharts using Mermaid language. These flowcharts would serve as a visual representation of the frameworks, helping users navigate through the copyright assessment process.

The first flowchart was based on QM’s EMu Copyright Documentation Guidelines, which focuses on assessing various aspects of a work's copyright status, including permissions, usage rights, and documentation.

The second flowchart stemmed from the GLAM-E Lab’s Copyright Clearance Handbook, which emphasizes evaluating public domain works, clearing permissions, and understanding specific copyright conditions tied to digital collections.

#### 3. Building the Interactive Tool: 
The next step was to build an interactive assessment tool. Using pull-down menus, I designed the tool so users can input information about a work. These inputs will guide the user through the decision tree and determine whether a work is copyrighted, in the public domain, or if certain conditions apply.

This week, I gained practical experience in using Mermaid for creating flowcharts. The syntax is straightforward, and it’s an effective tool for visualizing decision-making processes.
