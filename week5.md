## **week 2: build an interactive copyright status assessment tool**

This week’s task revolved around creating an interactive online copyright assessment tool, aimed at helping users evaluate the copyright status of works within the context of two established frameworks: the QM’s EMu Copyright Documentation Guidelines and the GLAM-E Lab’s Copyright Clearance Handbook for Public Domain Publications of Digital Collections. The tool, once completed, will allow users to determine the copyright status of works, as well as any specific conditions that might apply based on a series of yes/no questions and checkboxes. The overall goal was to combine these two frameworks into a streamlined, user-friendly tool that will make copyright evaluations accessible for a wide range of users.

Steps to Create the Tool:

Understanding the Frameworks: The first step involved familiarizing myself with the two copyright assessment frameworks: QM’s EMu Copyright Documentation Guidelines and the GLAM-E Lab’s Copyright Clearance Handbook. I reviewed both documents carefully, identifying key questions, decision points, and guidelines in each framework.

Creating Flowcharts with Mermaid: To visually represent the decision-making process involved in each framework, I created two detailed flowcharts using Mermaid language. These flowcharts would serve as a visual representation of the frameworks, helping users navigate through the copyright assessment process.

The first flowchart was based on QM’s EMu Copyright Documentation Guidelines, which focuses on assessing various aspects of a work's copyright status, including permissions, usage rights, and documentation.
The second flowchart stemmed from the GLAM-E Lab’s Copyright Clearance Handbook, which emphasizes evaluating public domain works, clearing permissions, and understanding specific copyright conditions tied to digital collections.
Building the Interactive Tool: With the flowcharts complete, the next step was to build the interactive assessment tool. Using pull-down menus and checkboxes, I designed the tool so users can input information about a work, such as its usage type, origin, and status of permissions. These inputs will guide the user through the decision tree and determine whether a work is copyrighted, in the public domain, or if certain conditions apply.

Integration and Comparison: As an added bonus, I implemented a way to compare the two frameworks side by side. This comparison feature helps users to evaluate the same work according to both the QM’s EMu guidelines and the GLAM-E Lab’s clearance handbook, presenting results for both frameworks in parallel. This side-by-side view not only highlights the differences between the two approaches but also provides more nuanced results for users who may be working in different contexts.

What I Learned After Finishing the Task:

Mermaid for Visual Flowcharts: I gained practical experience in using Mermaid for creating flowcharts. The syntax is straightforward, and it’s an effective tool for visualizing decision-making processes. It helped me break down the complex copyright guidelines into manageable and easily digestible parts.

Interactive Design Principles: Designing an interactive tool brought me face-to-face with key considerations for user interface and user experience (UI/UX). I had to think critically about how to make the tool intuitive, engaging, and easy to use. Simple elements like pull-down menus and checkboxes made the process seamless for users, yet I also had to ensure that the tool maintained accuracy and clarity when presenting complex copyright rules.

Copyright Evaluation in Practice: Diving into the practical application of copyright evaluation frameworks helped deepen my understanding of copyright law, especially in the context of digital collections and public domain works. By translating abstract guidelines into an interactive format, I gained a more solid grasp of the challenges and nuances involved in assessing the copyright status of various works.

Combining Frameworks: One of the most insightful aspects of the task was combining two distinct frameworks into a single tool. It was fascinating to compare the nuances of both frameworks and see how they intersected or differed in terms of copyright evaluation. The side-by-side results feature was particularly valuable in understanding how the same work might be treated differently depending on the assessment method.

Conclusion: This week’s task allowed me to merge technical skills (like building an interactive tool) with legal concepts (like copyright law). The end result is not just a functional tool but also a deeper understanding of the complexities of copyright evaluation. I look forward to continuing the development and refining the tool further, but for now, it feels satisfying to have created something that can help others navigate the complex world of copyright with ease.
