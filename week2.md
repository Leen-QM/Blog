## **Week 2: fork and tweak another museum’s project**

This week was focused on reusing an existing open source code to create an audio guide for one of the museums/exhibitions in Qatar.

The first step was to fork the ACMI repository (https://github.com/ACMILabs/static-museum-audio-guide) to my github account and customize it for the "Manzar" exhibition. I decided to experiment with developing an Arabic audio guide and evaluating the ability of existing text-to-speech programs to produce high-quality Arabic audios. It turned out that several tools produced good Arabic audios. but they required some fixing such as adding diacritical marks to improve the pronunciation of some words.

The main challenge I faced during this task was understanding the code in detail, as I was unfamiliar with jekyll framework. While the platform was well-organized, Jekyll’s templating system, combined with its use of Markdown files, caused me to spend some time leaarning how everything was structured.This helped me gain a deeper understanding of static site generation and how I could modify the code to suit my needs.

This week, I learned about the flexibility of Static Sites. After becoming used to jekyl, the platform was easy to modify and adapt to different types of exhibitions. This flexibility allowed me to quickly add content related to the chosen exhibiton.
